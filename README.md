# Two-Factor Authentication Simulation

This project is a Python-based simulation of a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system. It demonstrates the basic security principles of 2FA by combining traditional login credentials with a One-Time Password (OTP) mechanism.

## 🔐 Features

- User registration with username and password
- Secure login with OTP verification
- Random OTP generation
- Simple file-based storage for user data
- Educational implementation of 2FA logic

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Built-in libraries: `random`, `time`

## 📁 File Structure

- `otp_password.py` — Main script that handles registration, login, and OTP logic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your system
